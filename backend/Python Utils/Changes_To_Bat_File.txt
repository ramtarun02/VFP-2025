Technical Differences Between Interactive and Non-Interactive VFP Batch Scripts

1. Interactivity vs Argument Parsing
- Original Script (interactive): Uses `set /p` to request user input during execution (e.g. map name, geometry, flow file).
- New Script (non-interactive): Takes all necessary inputs via command-line arguments:
  set "_map=%~1"
  set "_geo=%~2"
  set "_flow=%~3"
  set "_excres=%~4"
  set "_cont=%~5"
  set "_dump=%~6"

2. File Existence Checks
- Original: Uses `if not exist ... goto :label` and loops back to re-request input.
- New: Performs `if not exist ... exit /b 1`, and exits early if files are missing. Also validates whether mandatory arguments are passed:
  if "%_map%"=="" (
    echo Usage: ...
    exit /b 1
  )

3. Flow File Generation
- Original: Contains logic to generate flow files interactively using visflow.exe, vfpfusegenv2.exe, vfptvkbodyv8.exe, based on user input like fuselage presence.
- New: Does not include any logic for generating flow files — assumes %_flow%.dat already exists and validates its existence.

4. Excrescence Handling
- Original: Prompts user interactively whether this is an excrescence run, and requests filename if yes.
- New: Only checks if %_excres% is "y", but does not copy or process any excrescence file (it's a placeholder with a warning but no actual file handling logic).

5. Continuation Run Logic
- Original:
  - Asks interactively whether it's a continuation run.
  - If same Mach/alpha: auto-generates dump filename based on %_geo%%_flow%.
  - Else: requests separate dump base name via set /p.
- New:
  - If %_cont% is "y":
    - Requires %_dump% to be passed.
    - Verifies dump files exist.
    - Copies the full set of fortXX files without distinction between "same Mach/alpha" and general continuation.

6. `pause` Statements
- Original: Contains multiple pause statements throughout for user interaction.
- New: Contains no pause commands — script is fully automatic.

7. Wave Drag Preparation
- Original:
  - Includes pause before f137b1.exe.
  - Has a commented-out copy command:
    :copy wavedrg.dat wavedrg72.dat
- New:
  - Skips any use of wavedrg72.dat or related copy step.
  - Directly copies fort.70/71 and runs f137b1.exe.

8. Final Cleanup
- Original: Deletes each file with separate del commands.
- New: Deletes multiple files using ^ for line continuation in a single del command block:
  del fort.11 fort.15 ... wavedrg76.dat
