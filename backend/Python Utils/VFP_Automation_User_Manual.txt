USER MANUAL FOR AUTOMATED VFP BATCH RUNNER
==========================================

Description:
------------
This Python script automates the execution of Viscous Full Potential (VFP) simulations by calling `.bat` batch files 
based on the flow condition `.dat` files found in a specific folder. (The flow files are generated by default in the correct directory.)

Key Features:
-------------
- Extracts angle of attack (AoA) from `.dat` filenames in the 'Flow_Conditions' directory.
- Sorts the AoA values in ascending order.
- Runs the first case without continuation using `runvfphe_v4.bat`.
- Runs all remaining cases as continuation runs using `runvfphe_v4.bat`.

File Structure:
---------------
Assume the following directory layout:

    project_directory/
    ├── All Python scripts. (This includes: VFP_Full_Process.py, VFP_Run_Main_V3.py, VFP_Data_Extraction(Utils & Main), VFP_File_Generation(Utils & Main).
    ├── runvfphe_v4.bat
    └── Flow_Conditions/
        ├── M085Re19p8ma-2p00.dat
        ├── M085Re19p8ma-1p50.dat
        └── ...
    ├── M085Re19p8ma-2p00.dat
    ├── M085Re19p8ma-1p50.dat
    └── ...

Instructions:
-------------

1. Place all `.dat` files in the `Flow_Conditions/` subfolder. (This will be done by the program by default.)
   These should follow the naming pattern: M<digits>Re<digits>p<digits>ma[+/-]<AoA>p<digits>.dat (e.g., M085Re19p8ma-2p00.dat)

2. Ensure that `runvfphe_v4.bat` is in the same directory as the main Python script.

3. Run the script from a terminal or IDE. It will prompt you to enter the initial flow file(that is, the flow run you wish to run without a continuation run), the MAP, and the GEO base name, for example:
	Enter the original .dat filename: M085Re19p8ma-1p00.dat
       Enter the MAP base name (e.g., CRM1wb): CRM1wb
       Enter the GEO base name (e.g., CRM1wb): CRM1wb


Notes:
------
- All `.dat` files must be in `Flow_Conditions/`.
- The batch files assume that the input `.dat` file (from the third argument) exists in the current working directory.
  If this is not the case, copy or link the `.dat` file into the working directory before executing the batch file.
- If any filenames contain spaces, wrap them in double quotes when modifying or extending the script.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
- If the batch file fails, ensure that:
  a. The `.dat` file exists in the correct location.
  b. The filenames are passed correctly.
  c. You are not missing quotes around filenames with spaces.
- If the `.bat` file needs a specific working directory, you may need to `os.chdir(...)` into that directory from Python.

User Input Format Guide
========================

When prompted to enter input (e.g., the MAP and GEO base name), follow these conventions exactly to ensure the script works correctly:

1. **Flow File Generation**

   - Enter the full name of the original flow file, including the extension.
   - Make sure that the original file exists in the same folder as the Python scripts.
   - Do NOT include any directory paths. The script assumes these files are in the current directory.
   - After file generation, there would be 2 versions of each flow file(one in the "Flow_Conditions" folder and one in the scripts directory)


2. **MAP and GEO Base Name**
   - This is a base string common to both the MAP and GEO files used in the batch simulation.
   - Example: If your files are named `CRM1wb.map` and `CRM1wb.geo`, then you should enter:

     ```
     CRM1wb
     ```

   - Do NOT include file extensions like `.map` or `.geo`.
   - Do NOT include any directory paths. The script assumes these files are in the current directory.

3. **Flow Condition Files**
   - These must be `.dat` files stored inside the `Flow_Conditions/` folder.
   - They should follow the naming convention:

     ```
     M<digits>Re<digits>p<digits>ma<AoA>.dat
     ```

     Examples:
     - `M085Re19p8ma-2p00.dat`
     - `M085Re19p8ma+1p00.dat`

   - The script extracts the AoA automatically from the filename and uses the **base name without extension** when calling the batch files.
   - The number of AoAs needed, as well as the increment step, can be modified inside the "VFP_File_Generation_Utils.py" -> NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS (set to 20 by default) or -> STEP (set to 0.25 by default)

4. **Important Notes**
   - Do not move `.dat` files into the main script directory unless you explicitly change the script to look there.
   - If modifying the script or batch files, ensure that paths are correctly handled and filenames are properly quoted if they contain spaces.
   - Missing wavedrag or forces files will create errors in the code. Do not delete any files until the code is complete.
